"""Host integration point: a subclassable bracket diagram.

The library is a pure renderer. To plug a host system into it, subclass
:class:`PlayoffDiagram`, override the hooks you need, instantiate it with the JSON
document and call :meth:`render`::

    svg = MyDiagram(document).render()

Resolution is automatic: whenever a leg in the document carries a ``ref``,
:meth:`get_match` is called with it. Legs without a ``ref`` are left untouched.
