"""Host integration point: a subclassable knockout stage diagram.

The library is a pure renderer. To plug a host system into it, subclass
:class:`KnockoutStage`, override the hooks you need, instantiate it with the JSON
document and call :meth:`render`::

    class MyDiagram(KnockoutStage):
        def get_match(self, ref):
            game = my_db.fetch(ref)
            return {
                "team1": game.home_team, "goals1": game.home_goals, "pen1": game.home_pens,
                "team2": game.away_team, "goals2": game.away_goals, "pen2": game.away_pens,
            }

        def get_tournament(self):
            return championship.name

        def get_season(self):
            return str(championship.year)

    svg = MyDiagram(document).render()

Resolution is automatic: whenever a leg in the document carries a ``ref``,
:meth:`get_match` is called with it. Legs without a ``ref`` are left untouched.
:meth:`get_crest` can likewise supply each side's crest/flag image from the side's
identity; the document itself never carries images.

The diagram also *maintains* its document: :meth:`KnockoutStage.apply_results` writes
played results onto the JSON in place (and, unless told otherwise, settles the winners),
so a host can keep the stored document up to date without touching its structure.
