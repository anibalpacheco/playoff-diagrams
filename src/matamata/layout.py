"""Deterministic geometry for a single-elimination knockout stage.

Rounds become columns laid out left to right. Each match is a fixed-size box with a
home row and an away row. A match in a later round is centered vertically between the
matches it consumes (resolved through ``winner_of``); first-round matches are stacked
with a fixed gap. No external layout engine is involved.
