"""Parsed, in-memory representation of a knockout stage document, plus display helpers.

The shapes here mirror the JSON language described in ``docs/format.md``. Keeping the
models as plain dataclasses avoids any third-party dependency.

The renderer is intentionally a *pure renderer*: it never computes who advances. The
winner of a match is whatever the document's explicit ``winner`` field says, and an
unresolved ``winner_of`` slot is drawn as a placeholder unless the document (or live
data injected through :class:`~matamata.diagram.KnockoutStage`) already carries
a resolved team name on it. Filling the knockout stage forward is the job of whatever maintains
the JSON, not of this library.
