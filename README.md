Render a football (soccer) **playoff bracket** as an **SVG**, on the fly, from a
**JSON source document**.

The bracket is described by a small JSON "language" that is meant to live in a
database field (e.g. Postgres `JSONB`) on a championship/cup entity. Updating results
means editing that JSON — no code changes, and no per-cup HTML templates to maintain.

## Examples

Both diagrams below are rendered from the JSON files in [`examples/`](examples/), with
no per-cup templates involved.

Two-legged ties ([`libertadores-2026.json`](examples/libertadores-2026.json)) — each
leg's goals are shown, shootouts appear in parentheses, and the winner of each tie is
emphasized. The first quarterfinal is **host-resolved**: its legs carry only a `ref`, so
its teams and scores come from `get_match` (see
[`examples/libertadores_host.py`](examples/libertadores_host.py)) rather than from the
document. Played ties take their team names from the legs; the final is a single match —
one leg, so just one goal figure per side — with its `winnerof` links carrying the bracket:

Single matches ([`knockout-8.json`](examples/knockout-8.json)) — one goal figure per
side, with shootouts in parentheses. Sides that have not been resolved yet fall back to
placeholders such as "Winner SF2":

## Why JSON (and not a DSL or Graphviz `.dot`)

- **Native database support** and a universal parser.
- A bracket node can evolve from a **placeholder** (e.g. "winner of QF1") into a
  **reference to a real match entity** without changing the language: each leg can carry
  a `ref` to the real game, resolved dynamically by the host (see below).
- The bracket layout is **deterministic** (it is essentially a tree), so no general
  graph-layout engine is needed — coordinates are computed directly and the SVG is
  emitted as a string, with no heavy dependencies.

## The format

See [`spec/format.md`](spec/format.md) for the full specification and
[`spec/schema.json`](spec/schema.json) for the JSON Schema. Worked examples live in
[`examples/`](examples/).

Minimal example:

```json
{
  "tournament": "Copa Libertadores",
  "season": "2026",
  "rounds": [
    {
      "name": "Final",
      "matches": [
        {
          "id": "final",
          "legs": [
            { "team1": "Flamengo", "goals1": 1, "team2": "Nacional", "goals2": 2 }
          ],
          "winner": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Quickstart

Requires Python ≥ 3.10. No runtime dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anibalpacheco/playoff-diagrams.git
cd playoff-diagrams
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Render a self-contained example to an SVG file:

```bash
# via the installed command
playoff-diagrams examples/knockout-8.json -o knockout.svg

# or via the module, writing to stdout
python -m playoff_diagrams examples/knockout-8.json > knockout.svg
```

Open the resulting `.svg` in a browser to view the bracket. To render your own cup,
point the command at any JSON file that follows [`spec/format.md`](spec/format.md).

The Copa Libertadores example has a host-resolved tie (its legs carry only a `ref`), so
the CLI alone can't fill it; render it through its example host instead:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python examples/libertadores_host.py > libertadores.svg
```

Use it from Python:

```python
from playoff_diagrams import load_bracket, render_svg

svg = render_svg(load_bracket("examples/knockout-8.json"))
```

### Use it in another project (e.g. a Django app)

It is a standard pip-installable package with no runtime dependencies. To add it to
another project's virtual environment, install it straight from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/anibalpacheco/playoff-diagrams.git
```

Pin a specific release or commit with `...playoff-diagrams.git@<tag-or-sha>`, or add
that same line to your `requirements.txt`. For a self-contained document, render it
straight away:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from playoff_diagrams import parse_bracket, render_svg

def bracket_svg(request, championship):
    svg = render_svg(parse_bracket(championship.bracket_json))
    return HttpResponse(svg, content_type="image/svg+xml")
```

#### Injecting live data and dynamic title (`PlayoffDiagram`)

The renderer never computes results: the winner of a match is its explicit `winner`
field, and an advancing team is whatever `team1`/`team2` the document records on a match.
To feed live data from your own database instead of (or on top of) the JSON, subclass
`PlayoffDiagram`. Whenever a leg carries a `ref`, `get_match(ref)` is called with it; you
return that one game as a flat dict, local first (`team1`/`goals1`, `team2`/`goals2`). The
tournament name and season can also be supplied dynamically:

```python
from playoff_diagrams import PlayoffDiagram

class ChampionshipDiagram(PlayoffDiagram):
    def __init__(self, championship):
        super().__init__(championship.bracket_json)
        self._championship = championship

    def get_match(self, ref):
        g = Match.objects.get(pk=ref)            # your own model
        return {
            "team1": g.home.name, "goals1": g.home_goals, "pen1": g.home_pens,
            "team2": g.away.name, "goals2": g.away_goals, "pen2": g.away_pens,
        }

    def get_tournament(self):
        return self._championship.name

    def get_season(self):
        return str(self._championship.year)

def bracket_svg(request, championship):
    svg = ChampionshipDiagram(championship).render()
    return HttpResponse(svg, content_type="image/svg+xml")
```

`get_match` returns only what it has — any of `team1`/`goals1`/`pen1` and their `2`
counterparts; a returned `None` leaves that leg as the document defines it. Where a side
has no team yet, the resolved name is filled in from the live game while the bracket
connector (`winnerof1`/`winnerof2`) is kept.

The document's display preferences are available to the hooks as `self.render_config`,
so `get_match` can, for instance, read `self.render_config.max_label_chars` and return
already-shortened names. Long-named cups can raise that limit (it defaults to `22`) in
the document's `render` object.

### Running the tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

The suite includes golden (snapshot) SVG tests under `tests/golden/`. When output
changes on purpose, regenerate them with `PD_REGEN=1 pytest tests/test_render.py` and
review the diff.

## Scope

**Single-elimination**, with single matches and two-legged ties decided by penalty
shootouts.

## Status

Working: the language spec, JSON Schema, Python renderer, CLI and tests are in place,
and the package is installable from GitHub.
